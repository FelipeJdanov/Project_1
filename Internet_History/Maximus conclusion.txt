The highest rates of access are in South Korea (94%), Australia (93%) and Canada (90%), but rates of over 80% also occur in the U.S.,\
UK, Spain, Israel and Germany.Many large emerging economies have at least 60% of their population using the internet, including 72%\
in Russia and Turkey, 68% in Malaysia, 65% in China and 60% in Brazil.Overall, internet rates are lower in poorer countries,\
concentrated mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, including 39% in Nigeria, 30% in Indonesia and 22% in India.\
The lowest access rates are found in some of the poorest countries surveyed, such as Burkina Faso (18%), Pakistan (15%), Uganda (11%)\
and Ethiopia (8%).Regionally, more people have access to the internet in North America and Europe compared with other parts of the\
world. Still, many people in the Middle East have internet access, including 86% in Israel, 72% in the Palestinian territories and\
67% in Jordan.In Latin America, a median of 64% have access to the internet, with the highest rates in Chile (78%) and Argentina (71%)\
and the lowest rates in Mexico (54%) and Peru (52%).Asian-Pacific nations are quite varied in their internet access rates. As a\
result of the wide range of national incomes, the region includes the most wired nations in the survey (South Korea and Australia)\
along with some of the least wired (India and Pakistan).Many of the least economically developed nations surveyed are in sub-Saharan\
Africa, and consequently, only a quarter of the adult population across the nine African nations surveyed has internet access.\
There is a strong correlation (0.87) between country wealth (as measured by per-capita gross domestic product on a purchasing\
power-adjusted basis) and internet access. Poorer nations, such as those in South and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, have\
much lower internet rates compared with richer developing countries in Latin America and the Middle East, as well as rich nations in\
Europe, North America and East Asia and the Pacific.}
