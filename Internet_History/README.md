## Project Proposal
This project will analyze the annual history of Internet usage around the world, summarize its growth according to each country, and identify the influence of each country's GDP on the development of this means of communication.

This project aims to answer the following questions:

* How has the global internet user population changed from 1980 to 2020?
* Which countries have experienced the highest growth in internet users during this period?
* Is there a correlation between cellular subscription rates and internet user rates?
* How does broadband subscription affect internet user adoption and growth?
* Are there variations in broadband subscription rates among different countries and years?
* How do broadband subscription rates relate to the number of internet users in each country?
* What impact does the availability of broadband have on internet penetration rates?
* Can the growth of internet users and broadband subscriptions be linked to a country's economic development?

## Introduction:
This project aims to analyze the changes in global internet usage from 1990 to 2020 and explore the impact of internet usage on countries. We examined the global trends in internet usage, studied the variations in internet usage among different countries, and investigated the relationship between internet usage and economic development.


## Findings:
Our project reveals that internet usage has experienced significant growth, with the number of global internet users surpassing 4.7 billion in 2020. The United States and China have shown remarkable growth in internet usage, with China surpassing the United States in 2018 and becoming the country with the highest number of internet users.

There is a difference in internet usage between low-income and high-income countries. High-income countries consistently exhibit a higher percentage of internet users; however, we also observed a steady increase in internet usage in low-income countries, narrowing the gap.

Global cellular and broadband subscriptions have shown consistent growth. In 2020, there were 106.15 cellular subscriptions per 100 people, indicating widespread adoption of mobile phones. Broadband subscriptions per 100 people also witnessed continuous growth, reaching 15.89 subscriptions, reflecting the increasing demand for high-speed internet access.

There is a correlation between broadband subscription rates and internet user adoption. Higher broadband subscription rates generally coincide with a larger number of internet users, as broadband provides reliable and high-speed internet access, encouraging more individuals to connect to the internet.

Additionally, the availability of broadband significantly influences internet penetration rates. Broadband infrastructure enables more individuals to connect to the internet, resulting in higher penetration rates within a population.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the internet has experienced significant global expansion, with China emerging as the country with the highest number of internet users. Internet usage varies between low-income and high-income countries, but both have witnessed steady growth. Cellular and broadband subscriptions have increased, and higher broadband subscription rates correlate with increased internet user adoption. The availability of broadband plays a crucial role in internet penetration rates. Moreover, the growth of internet users and broadband subscriptions is closely tied to a country's economic development. The findings emphasize the transformative impact of the internet on global connectivity and its contribution to economic growth.
