## Project Proposal
This project will analyze the annual history of Internet usage around the world, summarize its growth according to each country, and identify the influence of each country's GDP on the development of this means of communication.

This project aims to answer the following questions:

* How has the global internet user population changed from 1980 to 2020?
* Which countries have experienced the highest growth in internet users during this period?
* Is there a correlation between cellular subscription rates and internet user rates?
* How does broadband subscription affect internet user adoption and growth?
* Are there variations in broadband subscription rates among different countries and years?
* How do broadband subscription rates relate to the number of internet users in each country?
* What impact does the availability of broadband have on internet penetration rates?
* Can the growth of internet users and broadband subscriptions be linked to a country's economic development?
