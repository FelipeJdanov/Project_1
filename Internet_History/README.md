## Project Proposal
This project will analyze the annual history of Internet usage around the world, summarize its growth according to each country, and identify the influence of each country's GDP on the development of this means of communication.
​
This project aims to answer the following questions:
​
*How has the global internet user population changed from 1980 to 2020?
*Which countries have experienced the highest growth in internet users during this period?
*How has the gap in internet usage between low-income and high-income countries evolved over the years?
*Is there a correlation between cellular subscription rates and internet user rates?
*Can the growth of internet users linked to a economic indicator(GDP) ? 
​
## Introduction:
The core message of the project is to analyze the evolution of the global internet user population and its correlation with economic indicators such as GDP. The hypothesis is that internet usage has grown significantly over the years, and there may be a correlation between internet adoption, economic development, and other factors like cellular subscription rates and broadband availability.
​
​
## Findings:
Our project reveals that internet usage has experienced significant growth, with the number of global internet users surpassing 4.7 billion in 2020. The United States and China have shown remarkable growth in internet usage, with China surpassing the United States in 2018 and becoming the country with the highest number of internet users.
​
The United States and China have been significant players in internet user growth. The United States consistently led in internet usage until 2007, while China experienced rapid growth and surpassed the United States in 2008, reaching over 1 billion internet users by 2020.
These findings highlight the significant growth and global impact of Internet usage, with China emerging as a key player in recent years.
Despite China surpassing the United States in terms of the number of internet users, the actual internet penetration rate in China is still lower than that of the United States.
​
​
There is a difference in internet usage between low-income and high-income countries. High-income countries consistently exhibit a higher percentage of internet users; however, we also observed a steady increase in internet usage in low-income countries, narrowing the gap.
​
Global cellular and broadband subscriptions have shown consistent growth. In 2020, there were 106.15 cellular subscriptions per 100 people, indicating widespread adoption of mobile phones. Broadband subscriptions per 100 people also witnessed continuous growth, reaching 15.89 subscriptions, reflecting the increasing demand for high-speed internet access.
​
There is a correlation between broadband subscription rates and internet user adoption. Higher broadband subscription rates generally coincide with a larger number of internet users, as broadband provides reliable and high-speed internet access, encouraging more individuals to connect to the internet.
​
Additionally, the availability of broadband significantly influences internet penetration rates. Broadband infrastructure enables more individuals to connect to the internet, resulting in higher penetration rates within a population.
​
## Discussion & Conclusion:
1. Worldwide Internet Usage:
​
The analysis reveals significant growth in worldwide internet usage, with the number of internet users surpassing 4.7 billion in 2020. High-income countries consistently show a higher percentage of internet users, while low-income countries have been gradually catching up, narrowing the gap.
​
2. Cellular and Broadband Subscriptions:
​
Cellular and broadband subscriptions have also been steadily increasing, reflecting the rising demand for mobile and high-speed internet access globally. Higher broadband subscription rates correlate with a larger number of internet users, highlighting the importance of reliable and fast internet connections.
​
3. Internet Usage by Country:
When examining internet usage by country, the United States traditionally led the way until China emerged as a dominant player in recent years. China overtook the United States in 2008, becoming the country with the highest number of internet users, surpassing 1 billion people in 2020. However, the internet penetration rate in China remains lower than that of the United States.
​
4. Correlation with Economic Development:
​
While a positive correlation generally exists between GDP and internet user growth, an interesting trend emerged starting from 2001. Internet users experienced a substantial increase, while GDP growth was relatively slow. This can be attributed to the prioritization of internet infrastructure and digital services over traditional economic sectors, potentially diverting resources and attention away from other areas and leading to slower GDP growth. Nevertheless, the increasing internet usage in low-income countries during this period signifies progress and potential for further development, contributing to the narrowing of the digital divide.
​
​
​
​
The findings highlight the transformative impact of the internet on global connectivity and its contribution to economic growth. it also emphasize the need for continued efforts to bridge the digital divide and ensure equal access to the internet across income groups and countries. The analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and organizations in understanding the trends, patterns, and potential opportunities associated with internet usage on a global scale.
​
In cases where the findings do not align with expectations, further investigation into specific factors such as infrastructure development, government policies, cultural differences, or socioeconomic factors becomes crucial to understand the disparities and unexpected trends.
## Postmortem
1.During the project, we faced difficulties in finding relevant data to compare with our main dataset. We spent a lot of time searching for additional sources and gathering data that could give us insights into internet usage trends and their impact on different countries.
To overcome this challenge, we used various research methods like exploring reputable databases, accessing reports and studies, and using open data platforms. We also collaborated within our team to share resources and knowledge, ensuring that we had a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
If we had two more weeks, we would focus on exploring more data sources to complement our main dataset. We would look into government reports, academic studies, and industry analyses to get a better understanding of global internet usage trends.
We would also conduct comparative analysis, comparing internet adoption rates between different regions, and demographic segments. This would help us understand the factors influencing internet usage and its impact on various populations.
Another area of focus would be examining the role of government policies and infrastructure development in promoting internet adoption and bridging the digital divide. We would analyze initiatives like broadband expansion programs, regulatory frameworks, and digital literacy campaigns to see how they affect internet usage in different countries.
By dedicating more time to these research areas, we could enhance our analysis and gain a more comprehensive understanding of global internet usage trends and their implications for different countries and populati

2. During our research, we faced challenges in finding updated data beyond 2020 and data that would allow us to compare internet usage with costs. Unfortunately, we couldn't find concise information on internet costs. However, exploring the relationship between internet usage and expenses would be an interesting topic for future research.
In summary, our findings provide insights into global internet usage, but more research is needed to explore the cost implications and the relationship between internet adoption and associated with expenses.
